                <li><strong>Industrial IoT Sabotage</strong> Criminals tamper with factory sensors to disrupt production.</li>
              </ul>

            <p><strong>Example Scenarios:</strong></p>
              <ul>

                <li>✔ More people are using smart homes, increasing attack surfaces.</li>
                <li>✔ Hackers can control or sabotage critical infrastructure using IoT vulnerabilities.</li>
              </ul>

            <p><strong>How to Prevent It:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>✅ Change default passwords on IoT devices</li>
                <li>✅ Regularly update firmware to fix security flaws.</li>
                <li>✅ Disable unnecessary IoT features that expose devices to risks.</li>
              </ul>
